## A step into Java
This program marks my first attempt at programming in Java, comming in from a background of C/C++ and Python

## Weather Tracking
Though written to be expandable, this program was born out of a need I had of lots and lots of time series data. As such, it only supports fetching of past data using Wunderground's API at the moment. It was compiled and tested under Open-JDK-7.
